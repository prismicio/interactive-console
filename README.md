# WIP prismic react

This is a simple [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) application with [Prismic.io](https://prismic.io/) integration.

### What's in it?

Just a simple [index.jsx](./index.jsx), [webpack.config.js](./webpack.config.js) and [index.html](./public/index.html) file.

### To run

Install webpack and the development server:

```
> $ npm i webpack-dev-server webpack -g
```

You can simply run webpack build using this command: 

```
> $ npm run build
```

If you want to run with webpack-dev-server simply run this command: 

```
> $ npm run dev
```

Open the web browser to `http://localhost:8080/`

Please contribute to the project if you think this can be done better in anyway even for this README :)
